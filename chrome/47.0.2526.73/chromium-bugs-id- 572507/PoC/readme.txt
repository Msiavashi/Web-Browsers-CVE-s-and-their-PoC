server.py is the example server provided by the original PoC and the server.js is written by me just in case there is no python installed (also on my vm) .

to use server.js :
1 - run the server on any port (default is 3000)
2 - open the url : http://127.0.0.1:[your port]/site1
3 - then kill the server and run it with another port
4 - open the url : http://127.0.0.1:[your port]/site2

if you see the cookie : site1 then your browser is vulnerable .

this PoC has also tested on v52 and it also worked .
